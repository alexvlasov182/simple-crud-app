# Simple CRUD Application

## Overview

This repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js and Express. The project serves as a foundational example for building RESTful APIs and demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests and manage server-side logic.

## Key Features

- Express Framework: Lightweight and flexible framework for building server-side applications.
- CRUD Operations: Supports creation, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- RESTful API: Implements RESTful routes and adheres to best practices for API development.
- JSON Data Handling: Processes and responds with JSON format for easy client integration.
- Middleware: Utilizes Express middleware for request parsing and error handling.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- Express.js: Fast and minimal framework for web applications.
- Body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- Nodemon: For automatic server restarting during development.
- Mongodb

## What's Inside

- Routes: API endpoints for each CRUD operation (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Controllers: Functions that handle business logic for each route.
- Middleware: Basic middleware for parsing JSON and handling errors.
- Server Configuration: Centralized server setup for easy scalability.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/simple-crud-app.git
cd simple-crud-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```
npm run dev or yarn dev
```

## Sample Endpoints

- Create a record: POST /api/items
- Read all records: GET /api/items
- Read a single record: GET /api/items/:id
- Update a record: PUT /api/items/:id
- Delete a record: DELETE /api/items/:id

## Customization Tips

- Modify the route handlers in src/routes for custom logic.
- Add authentication (e.g., JWT) for secured routes.
